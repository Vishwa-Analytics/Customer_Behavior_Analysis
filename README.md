🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Loading
Imported dataset into Python using Pandas
Verified data structure, data types, and basic statistics

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions, trends, and patterns
Identified missing values, duplicates, and outliers
Used visualizations to understand relationships between variables

3. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Removed duplicates
Corrected data types
Standardized column names and formats

4. SQL Analysis
Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Wrote SQL queries using:
SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY
JOIN, ORDER BY
Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Extracted insights for reporting and dashboard creation

5. Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to the SQL database
Created interactive dashboards with:
KPIs
Charts and tables
Filters and slicers
Designed for business-friendly interpretation

6. Reporting & Presentation
